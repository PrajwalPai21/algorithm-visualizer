# Algorithm-Visualizer
This project is a JavaFX-based algorithm visualizer that displays the step-by-step execution of algorithms using animated visual elements. Algorithms operate on arrays represented as bars, allowing users to clearly see comparisons, swaps, and data movement during execution.

The project is built in Java with a focus on understanding core language concepts, algorithm behavior, and clean application structure.
